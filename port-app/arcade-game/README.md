## About The Project
A complete browser-based classic arcade game, done as one of the projects from Udacity's Front End Web Developer Nanodegree.

## Gameplay Rules
You have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The goal of the Player is to reach the water without colliding into any one of the enemies.
- The enemies move at varying speeds on the paved block portion of the game board
- You can control the Player by moving left, right, up and down
- Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the starting square
- Once the player reaches the water (i.e., the top of the game board), the game is won
Each time your player reaches the water (at the top) without colliding into any enemies, you score 10 points.
The player has 3 lives and could die 3 times before the game is over.
Let's try to win with the highest score!
